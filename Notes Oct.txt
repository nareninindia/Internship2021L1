Naming conventions
How to write comments
Inheritance - Copy properties of one class into another class

3rd Nov 2021
Review inheritance
Super
This

super - Access properties of parent class
this - Access properties of current class

5th Nov 2021
Final keyword
Access modifiers - public, private

final - stop child classes from overriding a method, to declare of constant
Access modifiers - public, private, protected, default
public - to give complete open access to a class's properties.
private - to give access to a class's properties inside that class only.

8th Nov 2021:
Access modifiers - protected, default

Windows
monitor.printW()
monitor.printi()
monitor.printn()
monitor.printd()
monitor.printo()
monitor.printw()
monitor.prints()
keyboard component -> some methods on monitor component -> monitor methods above are public.

CAPSLOCK -> WINDOWS
keyboard.enableCapslock() -> capsLockEnabled = true
monitor.printW()
monitor.printI()
monitor.printN()
monitor.printD()
monitor.printO()
monitor.printW()
monitor.printS()
keyboard component -> monitor doesn't need to know about keyboard capslock state -> enableCapsLock can be private
keyboard component -> some methods on monitor component -> monitor methods above are public.

if (capsLockEnabled) {
  monitor.printI();
} else {
  monitor.printi()
}

Login -> collect values from frontend - public -> login credentials match - private

protected - to give access to child classes only.
default - to give access to child classes and in same package.

9th November 2021:
instanceof keyword
interface

instanceof -> we can identify the Class/Interface type in runtime
We can declare parent type and assign an object of child class
During compilation, the property identification happens from the declared type. (LHS)
During running(runtime), the property running happens from the defined type. (RHS)

interface -> define constants, declare variables or methods
Child classes of interface should define the methods and variables declared in the interface.

Exercise - 9th November 2021:
0. Run the programs from today's class.
1. Create a studentId generation method in Student class (Same as exercise from Nov 1st)
<YearOfJoining><Course><RollNumber> if year after 2015
<RollNumber><Course><YearOfJoining> if older than 2015
2. Override the studentId generation method in CSEStudent class
<Course><RollNumber><YearOfJoining>
3. Declare a variable of type Student and assign an object of type CSEStudent to it.
4. Generate studentId for Student created in point 3.
5. Find whether Student(from point 3) is of type ECEStudent using instanceof keyword.
6. Create an empty interface CollegeGoer and let Student class implement CollegeGoer(using implements keyword)

OS -> Interface between user and machine.
Windows desktop - CPU, monitor, keyboard, mouse, CD writer, camera
Windows - Device drivers

interface CDWriting {
  void writeLine(String line); // declaring rules
}
interface CDReading {
  String readLine(); // declaring rules
}

class DellCDWriting implements CDWriting, CDReading {
  void writeLine(String line) {
    // Using lasers to write onto the disc
  }
  String readLine() {
    // Logic for reading from CD drive
  }
}

Select mp3 file -> Write to CD
CDWriting cdWriting = new DellCDWriting();
for (;;) {
  cdWriting.writeLine(...); // Using lasers to write onto the disc
}
mp3 file written on to the disc

Interfaces define rule for child classes.

interface Camera {
  void takePhoto(); // rules
  void applyBWFilter();
}

class DellCamera {
  void takePhoto() {
   // Open shutter, take light in and close shutter
  }
}

Operating the camera using mouse. [mouse, monitor, CPU, camera]
OS doesn't know which method to call.
camera.takePhoto()

Spring and Spring Boot -> Web applications/Advanced Java
Spring Boot -> interfaces
Devs -> implement Spring Boot related rules and then write code.
Devs -> Framework - Declaring rules
Other devs -> Implement our framework/rules

Exercise 10th Nov 2021: // implements, extends, instanceof
7. Declare a method for id generation in CollegeGoer interface.
8. Implement this id generation method in Student class and all sub classes of student.
9. Create a new class Faculty which implements CollegeGoer interface.
10. Implement this id generation method in Faculty class.

// implements, extends, instanceof

11th Nov 2021:
implements - multiple, extends - 1
abstract class

public interface Person {
  public void getName();
  ....
}

public interface CollegeGoer {
  public void getUniqueId();
}

public class Student implements CollegeGoer, Person { // You can implement any number of interfaces
  public void getUniqueId() {
    // Generating unique id logic
  }
  public void getName() {

  }
}

public class CSEStudent extends Student {
  public void getUniqueId() {
    // Generating unique id logic
  }
}

public class ECEStudent extends Student {
  public void getUniqueId() {
    // Generating unique id logic
  }
}

public class Intern extends CSEStudent, ECEStudent { // This is not valid in Java - multiple inheritance

}

public class CSEIntern extends CSEStudent {

}

public class ECEIntern extends ECEStudent {

}

CollegeGoer is interface
Student class is implementing CollegeGoer interface
CollegeGoer declared getUniqueId method
Student class has implementation for getUniqueId method, StudentId has definition for getUniqueId method
CSEStudent class inheriting (extending) Student class
CSEStudent class is overriding getUniqueId method

Multiple interfaces can be implemented in one class.
Multiple classes cannot be inherited at once in on class. Multiple inheritace is not allowed in Java.
Multi level inheritance is allowed in Java.

Vehicle -> Car -> TataCar [Multi level inheritance]

abstract class = features of class + features of interface
class should define all methods in it
interface should only declare methods
abstract class can define a few methods and can just declare a few methods.

We can't create an object for an interface
We can't create an object for an abstract class
abstract class can implement an interface
class should extend an abstract class for inheriting it.

Exercise 11th Nov 2021:
1. Create a Person interface with getName method
2. Inherit it in CollegeGoer interface
3. Make CollegeGoer2 as an abstract class which implements Person interface
4. Do not implement getName method in the abstract class CollegeGoer2. Show what happens and explain it.
5. Take Student2 class and inherit CollegeGoer2. Do not implement getName method. Show what happens and explain it.

12th Nov 2021:

Java features:
Object-oriented - All programmning is based on classes and objects.
inheritance - Getting properties from a parent class into a child class.
abstraction - Provide declartions without implementations. - using abstract classes and interfaces (in Java)
encapsulation - should be able to hide inner working of a class - using all access modifiers public, private, protected and default (in Java)

JVM - Java Virtual Machine (a specification for JRE)
JRE - Java Runtime Environment (JRE is implementation of JVM)
JDK - Java Development Kit

Java Program -> Compile it -> .java gives .class in bytecode -> JRE can understand bytecode

OS is a big box -> JRE/JVM is small box inside the OS box
1. Any issues in the JRE/JVM will not affect the OS. They will be limited to the JRE.
2. You can create multiple JRE/JVMs at once.
3. Program execution is platform agnostic. (Linux, Mac OS, Windows)

JDK:
Enable writing java programs and compiling .java files to .class files

LG TV (Java)
To write the LG TV OS they need JDK
LG TV needs just JRE to run and doesn't need JDK.

inner class: SHould be avoided
Student.java
public class Student {

  public inner class CollegeGoer {

  }
}

15th Nov 2021:
Memory allocation
Static
Documentation through comments

Memory allocation:
class area, heap, stack, registers

javac Student.java
java Student.class

All class files are loaded into JRE -> JRE verfies the class files -> Program runs
Classes, methods -> Class area // HelloWorld.class, HelloWorld.main(...), Student.studentsCount -- Load the class
Objects -> Heap area [vehicle obj] // h1 = new HelloWorld(), h1.nonStaticVariable, h1.xyz() {HelloWorld.main(...)} -- Run
Stack -> local variables [vehicle]
Registers -> Memory mapping [vehicle <-> vehicleObj]

Vehicle vehicle = new Vehicle();

JRE -> search for the main method -> Run the main method

Static methods can access static properties only directly.
Non-static methods can access static properties without any problem.

Final:
variable -> constant
method -> cannot override
class -> cannot inherit

Static:
method -> It will allow us to access a method directly using a class. Object is not required. - Avoided
variable -> Can be accessed directly from class. - Avoided
Objects will not have their own copies of static variables and static methods
class -> Can be accessed directly from the class containing it.

Student.java -> Student.class, Student.CollegeGoer.class
public class Student {

}

public static class CollegeGoer {

}

Student.CollegeGoer collegeGoer = new Student.CollegeGoer();

Java Exercise 15th Nov 2021:
1. Create a public, static counter variable -> studentsCount, with initial value as 0, inside Student class
2. Whenever a new student object is created, this counter should increment. Write the incrementation logic inside constructors.
3. Write a HelloWorld class with a main method. Create a non-static variable in this class. Increment this variable inside the main method and print it.
4. Create a String constant in CSEStudent and ECEStudent classes with name code. CSEStudent.CODE = "CSE", ECEStudent.CODE = "ECE" by following all the conventions we discussed.
5. Install IntelliJ Java IDE - community edition


Java Exercise 16th Nov 2021:
1. Create a new method in Student class called runMainMethod().
2. Call main(...) method of HelloWorld from inside this runMainMethod().
3. main(...) method need a String array argument. Find how to create the String array and send it as argument.

6th December 2021:
LinkedList

Diff: LinkedList, ArrayList
1.LL. Elements are stored and connected through addresses.
1.AL. Elements are stored by indexes and one after the other.

Disadvantages:
1. LL memory usage is higher compared to AL
2. Reading is more complex compared to AL - Time
3. Reading based on index is also complex compared to AL. - Time

Advantages:
1. Adding values and removing values from the list is easier compared to AL

Reading is more - Go for AL
Editing is more - Go for LL

Java exercise - 8th Dec 2021
1. How Java compares objects to be same or not?

14th December 2021:
equals and hashCode
Map

List - Ordered collection of items -> ArrayList, LinkedList
Set - Unordered collection of items -> HashSet
Iterator - Traverse through a collection

Map, HashMap

Map - Unordered collection of <key, value> pairs

List -> A, B, C, D..
List.get(1) -> B

Map -> ("planet1", "Mercury"), ("planet2", "Venus"), ("planet3", "Earth")
Map.get("planet1") -> "Mercury"
Map.put("planet4", "Mars")
Map -> ("planet1", "Mercury"), ("planet2", "Venus"), ("planet3", "Earth"), ("planet4", "Mars")
Map.put("planet4", "Earth")
Map -> ("planet1", "Mercury"), ("planet2", "Venus"), ("planet3", "Earth"), ("planet4", "Earth")

Java exercise - 14th Dec 2021
1. Create a Student class with attributes id(String), name(String) and age(int)
2. Override equals and hashCode methods so that if 'id's of two Student objects are same, then those two students should be conisdered same.
3. Practice the Map example shown in class.

Java exercise - 15th Dec 2021:
1. Create a map of planets like in previous class.
2. Use 'Iterator' over map.keySet and print the values from the map.

HashMap - UnSync - Unordered keys
LinkedHashMap - UnSync - Ordered keys based on 'Linking' algorithm - Space and insertion time are higher compared to HashMap
ConcurrentHashMap - Sync - Slower compared to LinkedHashMap or HashMap

16th December 2021:
try, catch, finally - Exceptions

Java exercise - 16th Dec 2021
1. Create a LinkedHashMap of Students - with id as key and Student as value.
2. Print the values of the LinkedHashMap.
3. Write a program to generate ArrayOutOfBoundsException.
4. Put it in try catch block.

17th December 2021:
try, catch, finally
throws and throw
Exceptions and Custom exceptions

try-catch-finally -> Catch exceptions
At least one catch block or one finally blockis required for a try block
You can stack catch blocks or you can catch multiple exceptions from one catch block.
Only one finally block can be written for a try block.
finally block is guaranteed to be executed independent of catching an exception.
Common things for finally block are closing a file connection or DB connection or releasing resources.

throws -> Sending the responsibility of catching an exception to a higher function.

throw -> Send/throw an exception

FB friends -> 5000 friends
5001th friend -> throw FriendLimitReachedException

SBI -> Current price -> Rs.500
Buy order -> Rs.10 -> throw NotAValidPriceException

Java exercise - 17th Dec 2021
1. Continue previous program. When ArrayOutOfBoundsException happens throw a CustomException and catch it.
2. Create a singly linked list in Java - https://www.javatpoint.com/java-program-to-create-and-display-a-singly-linked-list
3. Extends the keywords document with new topics and revise all the previous topics.
4. Read about wrapper classes in Java.

Next topics in Java:
Wrapper classes
Threads, Runnable, CompletableFutures, ThreadPoolExecutor
Typecast
Unit testing

21st December 2021:
Wrapper classes

int -> Integer
int a = 5 -> Integer b = new Integer(5)
Integer b = new Integer("5");
String s5 = "-5"; // "abc"
int a = -5
Integer b = new Integer(s5);
int a = b.intValue();
int a = Integer.parseInt(s5);

int[][]
List<Integer> aList = new ArrayList<Integer>(10);
int a; // a=0
Integer a; //a=null

Advantages:
1. Easy methods to convert numbers from String format to int primitive type.
2. Helpful in collections framework.
3. Helpful to hold a null as default instead of 0.

int -> Integer
long -> Long
boolean -> Boolean
double -> Double
float -> Float
-----

Threads:
Serial execution/Synchronous -> One after the another; one line after another line
Parallel execution/Unsynchronous -> Run multiple methods at the same time.

addStringsToHashSet and addVehiclesToHashSet -> Run in parallel
MainThread {
  Thread {
    addStringsToHashSet()
  }
  Thread {
    addVehiclesToHashSet()
  }
  customComparison()
}

Thread -> Deviate from the main thread execution

Java exercise - 21st Dec 2021
1. Write a program to parse this String into double: "21.000000"
2. Create a thread to print numbers 1 to 100.
3. Create another thread in above thread to print number 101 to 200. (Nested threads)

22nd December 2021:
ThreadPoolExecutor
CompletableFutures

Thread vs Runnable:
Thread - It is a class. Thread needs a runnable for writing program execution.
Runnable - It is interface. Runnable needs any one way creating a thread mechanism.
CompletableFuture - It is a class.

ThreadPoolExecutor:
Execute multiple threads at the same time with a core thread pool size.
It will help us to not overload the processor with hundreds of threads and crash the system.

Java exercise - 22nd Dec 2021
1. Create 10 runnables for printing numbers: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300..., 901 to 1000.
2. Create a thread pool of core pool size as 1 and execute the runnables.
3. Create a thread pool of core pool size as 3 and execute the runnables.
Need to show the effect of #2 and #3 in class.

      totalBill = totalBill + allItems[index].bill;
    }
    // totalBill is available now
  }
})

-----
Department: id int primary key, name varchar(100) unique
Student: id int primary, name varchar(100) not null, departmentId int not null
departmentId -> foreign key referencing Department table

Department:
1, ECE

2, Vijay, CSE, 2
3, Ajith, CSE, 3
4, ajith, CSE, 3
5, Sujith, Mech, 3

Reasons for foriegn keys:
1. Our data should be clean
2. Automatic indexes

* Referencing column should be a primary key

Normalisation: Self learning

Distinct: Selecting distinct values

select * from Student where branch='CSE' - More efficient than NOT condition
select * from Student where NOT branch='ECE'

Order By
select * from Student order by name (ascending order)
select * from Student order by name ASC (ascending order)
4, ajith, CSE
3, Ajith, CSE
1, Arun, ECE
2, Vijay, CSE

select * from Student order by name DESC (descending order)
select * from Student ORDER BY name, branch ASC

Student -> id(int), name(varchar), branch(varchar)
1, A, ECE
2, Vijayghfgjbjsjjgj, [NULL]
3, Ajith, [NULL]

indexes/unique - some RDMS will not accept if a column accepts NULL

select * from Student where branch IS NULL (2nd, 3rd records)
select * from Student where branch IS NOT NULL (1st record)

LIMIT: Postgres
select * from Student LIMIT 2;
1, Arun, ECE, 1
2, Vijay, CSE, 2

select * from Student where name='Vijay' LIMIT 2;
2, Vijay, CSE, 2

SKIP: Postgres
select * from Student limit 2 skip 2;
select * from Student skip 2;

Pagination:
1,00,000 students
select * from Student (1,00,000 records)
Query execution is slow
RAM should hold 1,00,000. This will slow other apps
Not possible to read all 1L records at once.

20 students - 1st page
20 students - 2nd page
...

Gmail - Click to move to a different page
Facebook - As you scroll new pages will be loaded

select * from Student limit 20 skip 0 (Page 1)
select * from Student limit 20 skip 20 (Page 2)
select * from Student limit 20 skip 40 (Page 3)
....
select * from Student limit 20 skip 99,980 (Last page)

pageNumber = 1;
limit = 20; // also call pageSize
skip = (pageNumber - 1) * limit;
totalNumberOfPages = count/pageSize // 5000 pages

LIKE:
select * from Student where name LIKE '%jith' // Ajith, ajith, Sujith
select * from Student where name LIKE 'A%' // Arun, Ajith
select * from Student where name LIKE '%ji%' // Ajith, ajith, Sujith
select * from Student where name LIKE 'A%h' // Ajith

18th Jan 2022:
Relational DB and NoSQL
Foriegn keys: RDBMS

RDBMS: No redundancy
NoSQL: Redundancy

NoSQL -> Write could be slower, reading is very fast compared to RDMS.
RDBMS -> Data is well structured. Writes could be faster than NoSQL. Reads are comparitively slower.

Postgres -> Relational

----- Relational ----- MySQL, SQL server(MS SQL), Postgresql

2. Practice the JDBC connection and create classes for Student, Department and HOD. Store the resultSets in the objects.
3. Create projection classes and store data in them.
4. Practice #2 and #3 on all 6 queries.

25th Jan 2022:
1. Projections and DTO classes
2. Brief intro to Spring framework

HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH
Servelets

Web applications
Client -> Server
GET: Take request from client -> Servelet -> Process the request -> Frame the response -> Send response to client
POST: Send student data from client -> Servelet -> Process the request -> Frame the response -> Send response to client

Spring boot:
Entity -> Table, Id, Column, JoinColumn
JPARepository
Controller
Service
Component
Autowired
RestController

DB Table -> Class in Java -> Get data from DB and assign it to objects of that class
Student table -> Student class -> Get data from DB and assign it to objects of Student class

@Entity:
@Table
@Id
if integer -> AUTO INCREMENT on the column
if String -> Use Generator annotions to let spring framework create unique primary keys
@Column

Interface - JPARepository : Annotation - @Repository
Each entity will have one repository interface.
Just by writing the keyword based methods, we can have Spring generate the queries for us.
Advantages: Spring will generate performant queries, our code will be clean.
Keyword reference: https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.query-methods.query-creation

@Controller, @Service, @Component
Component is parent interface of Controller and Service.
Component - Spring manages the objects related to component, so that duplicate or unnecessary objects are not created.

Eg for Component: Connection object

Controller - All it gets is Component annotation funtionality. We write logic inside a controller.
Service - All it gets is Component annotation funtionality. We write logic inside a service.
Controllers are usually exposed to public through APIs
Services are accessed from Controllers
JPARepositories are accessed from Services

Controllers -> Services -> JPARepositories
We use Components inside Controllers and Services

All Components are retrieved from memory through Autowired annotation
